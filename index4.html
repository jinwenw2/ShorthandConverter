<!--
  I just created more headings and paragraphs. I used multiple selectors to perform different actions.
  I included 2 more colors maroon and yellow to match with the color scheme of the Not Started and In Progress boxes.
  I also added an additional task called the final task which can serve as a final goal. I used a selector to make that green.
  I also added a selector for text shadow and used it on completed to make stand out more.
  Most of these additions were done with additional colors in CSS. The text shadow was done using text-shadow.
